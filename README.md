# Python project
## Analysing data from excited state calculations in Gaussian

In this project I will write a tool to extract and organise data from log files obtained through vertical excitation calculations of molecules. 

### Roadmap

- [x] models.py to store data
- [x] logparser.py to parse log file
    - [x] States
    - [x] Transitions
- [ ] Documentation
- [x] render.py to print the data in a simple table
- [ ] Terminal interface

#### Future features
- [ ] export.py to present the data in a csv format or similar
- [ ] Make rendering customisable
- [ ] Pretty print classes
- [ ] Possibility to add character to the recognised orbitals
